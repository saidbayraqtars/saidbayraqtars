Profile

Software engineer focused on system design, backend architecture, and practical engineering solutions.

Primary work includes self-driven technical projects, web-based systems, automation pipelines, and performance-oriented applications.
Game development is limited to experimental research and engine-level exploration.

I prioritize clean architecture, deterministic behavior, performance profiling, and maintainable codebases.
